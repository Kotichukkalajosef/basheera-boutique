# Elegance Boutique Website

## Overview
This is a static boutique website designed to showcase blouse designs and maggam work in a visually rich, e-commerce-like layout. The website does not include any prices or payment system. Instead, users can view different designs by category and click a WhatsApp button below each image, which sends the design info/image to the boutique's WhatsApp for further communication.

## ðŸš€ Dynamic Configuration System

This website now features a **dynamic configuration system** that makes it incredibly easy to add new categories, age groups, and items. All content is centrally managed through the `siteConfig` object in `script.js`.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- **Centralized Configuration**: All content defined in one place
- **Automatic HTML Generation**: Elements are generated dynamically
- **Easy Maintenance**: Add new content with minimal code changes
- **Flexible Structure**: Supports both single-page and multi-page categories
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to expand with new age groups or categories

### ðŸ“– Quick Start Guide

See `DYNAMIC_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on how to:
- Add new age groups (e.g., "Teens")
- Add new categories (e.g., "Party Wear")
- Configure images and descriptions
- Set up navigation patterns

### ðŸŽ¯ Example: Adding a New Category

To add a new category like "Party Wear":

1. **Add to configuration** in `script.js`:
```javascript
party: {
    name: 'Party Wear',
    description: 'Festive celebration attire',
    storyImage: 'images/home-imgs/party.jpg',
    storyLabel: 'Party',
    isSinglePage: false,
    availableFor: ['women', 'kids'],
    urlPatterns: {
        women: 'party-women.html',
        kids: 'party-kids.html'
    }
}
```

2. **Create HTML files**: `party-women.html`, `party-kids.html`
3. **Add story image** to `images/home-imgs/`

That's it! The system automatically generates all the necessary HTML elements and navigation logic.
